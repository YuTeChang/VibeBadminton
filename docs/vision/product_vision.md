# VibeBadminton – Product Vision

## Overview

VibeBadminton is a tiny web/mobile app that helps groups of friends track their badminton doubles games during a session and automatically calculates wins/losses, gambling results, shared costs, and final "who owes who how much" at the end of the night.

## Problem Statement

Casual badminton groups constantly forget:
- Who won how many games
- Who owes what money
- The breakdown of costs (court, birds, bets)
- Final settlement amounts

This leads to confusion, forgotten debts, and awkward money conversations at the end of sessions.

## Target Users

- Casual badminton groups (4-6 players typically)
- Friends who play doubles regularly
- Groups that bet small amounts per game
- People who want to track their performance over time (future feature)

## Long-term Goals

1. **Session Tracking** - Log games in real-time during play
2. **Automatic Money Settlement** - Calculate who owes what automatically
3. **Player History** - Track wins/losses across sessions (post-MVP)
4. **Elo Ratings** - Maintain skill ratings for balanced teams (post-MVP)
5. **Head-to-Head Stats** - See matchup statistics between players (post-MVP)
6. **Multi-Sport Support** - Extend to pickleball, volleyball, etc. (post-MVP)

## Key Features (Future)

- **MVP**: One screen to log games + one screen to show money breakdown
- **Post-MVP**:
  - Player history & Elo ratings
  - Head-to-head and teammate stats
  - Flexible settlement (multiple prepayers)
  - Multi-sport support
  - Accounts & persistence
  - AI helper layer (team suggestions, auto-summaries)

## Success Metrics

- **MVP Success**: Users can complete a full session (create session, log games, see final settlement) without confusion
- **User Satisfaction**: Groups use it consistently for their sessions
- **Time Saved**: Reduces end-of-night calculation time from minutes to seconds
